TODO: 
    High-Priority:
        * update regions3.c/region3_grow() and grdient.c/isaligned3() to correct
            region growing of lines in the spatial plane.  Neccessary to ensure 
            enough star-streaks for plate solving step
        * astrometry.net plate solving after edge detections
        * update regions3.c/regions3_growORTH() to solve linearity constraint, 
            using non-linear region growing using transformed line priors
        * detect_outliers.py/detect_outliers() update pca/gmm solution to be 
            more robust to reduced point sets (eg 0.5 scaling in demo.py/__main__)
            for faster prototyping 
    Medium-Priority
        * sliding window with overlap given large data for import_fits,
            to prevent memory crashing
        * ASTRIA-Net pipeline integration 
    Low-Priority
        * for acceleration when not involving loops to compute markov kernels,
            compute gradient matrices only once and share across LSD3M
